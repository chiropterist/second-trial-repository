ME is a new ministry, sponsored by the SoM, created to work toward the sustainability of all life. We live at a time when the Earth community faces many challenges. ME stands ready to face these challenges in a variety of ways by assisting individuals and communities to bring about a future full of promise.

ME's programs and projects have a potential to inspire, liberate and transform. Educational seminars, service projects and retreats offer opportunities for you to become more aware of your interconnectedness with others and the universe.  

Only you can play your role in the Story of the Universe. Do you need to reconnect with nature? Would you like to plant or harvest a garden, or maybe learn how to compost or recycle?  Have you always wanted to learn how to be kinder to the environment, or to engage with others about the issues of our times?  ME can partner with you for these needs and more.

ME has specialized programs at MF in Benson, Vermont, and at ND in Cumberland, Rhode Island. Browse our web site for the latest details about what is being offered at these sites.  Please contact us with questions, suggestions, or to share your expertise.
